    <h3>A View from Above</h3>
    <p>This building is dedicated to Civil and Architectural Engineering (<em>VÃ¤g- och vattenbyggnad</em>). That means the research here is concrete and practical: analyzing the lifespan of a bridge, tracking how materials degrade over decades, or measuring the precise time concrete needs to cure. Other studies focus on rates and cycles, such as the flow of water through a system or the timing patterns of traffic. The performance of buildings is also key, especially their energy use through daily and seasonal periods. All of these fields are linked by the practical need to measure and predict change over time.</p>
