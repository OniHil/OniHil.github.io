    <h3>Swedish Defense Research Agency (FOI)</h3>

    <p>Before you stands the Swedish Defense Research Agency. Their least favorite and an emperor's favorite cipher have been used to yield the following message:</p>
    
    <p><code>Tb gb xgurfgre tvguho vb gvgnacbvagr</code>.</p>
    
    <p>To find the key, go to the nearby triangular area, count the number of benches, and use that number as the cipher's shift value.</p>
