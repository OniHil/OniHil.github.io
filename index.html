              <p> Forgot your lunch at home? No worries! The lunch lectures we organize do not only save you from spending precious CSN-money, but gives you opportunities to be inspired by the exciting works of doctoral students and researchers. 
                Ever wondered what a doctoral student does? Or had that really specific research question that both Google and ChatGPT failed to answer? Now's your time to ask! </p>

            <div>
              <p> Through study trips we explore beyond the lecture halls, where theory meets practice. Meet the team of scientists behind the experiments you've only seen posters of. These are great opportunities to connect with peers and experts with similar interests. Maybe we could visit your dream workplace next? As always: the sky (i.e. the budget) is the limit! </p>
