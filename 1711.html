    <h3>M-Building (Mechanical Engineering)</h3>
    
    <p>You've arrived at the M-Building, the home of Mechanical Engineering. This is where the physical world is engineered.</br>
        
        Within these walls, researchers explore fundamental questions: How does a material bend under stress?</br>
    How can heat be converted into useful work? </br>
    How do fluids flow over a surface? </br>
    But this field is no longer just about gears and engines.</br>
    
    Today, these core principles are merged with advanced electronics and intelligent control systems to create the field of mechatronics.</p>
