    <h3>The Missing Piece</h3>
    <p>As you ascend the hill of Albanova, you find yourself at a unique intersection of knowledge. This is the AlbaNova University Center, a collaborative venture where minds from both the KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm University converge. The very building is a bridge between disciplines, housing research in physics, astronomy, and biotechnology. Here, scientists gaze outwards to the cosmos and inwards to the very building blocks of life, seeking to solve the universe's greatest puzzles.</p>
    
    <h4>The Scientists on the Hill</h4>
    <p>Use the map of KTH &cap; SU to form a matrix. You don't have much time left to find the missing data - as days and years go by the puzzle may remain unsolved.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the scientists on the hill are the ones housing the key to solving the completed piece?</p>
