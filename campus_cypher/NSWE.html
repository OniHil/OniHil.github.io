    <h3>Swedish Defense Research Agency (FOI)</h3>
    <p>
      You've arrived at a place shrouded in discretion and intellect: the
      Swedish Defense Research Agency (FOI). This is a hub of national
      importance, where researchers delve into everything from security policy
      to the complexities of underwater acoustics and cybersecurity. The work
      here is to see what others cannot, to decode the intentions and
      capabilities of others while protecting one's own secrets.

      favorite and an emperor's favorite cipher have been used to yield the
      following message:
    </p>
    <p><code>Tb gb xgurfgre tvguho vb nysirafnyra</code>.</p>
    <p>
      The key is on the ground. Find the place with three points of view, and
      count the opportunities for rest within.
