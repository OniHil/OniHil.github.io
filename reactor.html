    <h3>Reactor hall</h3>
    <p>The KTH Reactor Hall (Reaktorhallen), officially known as R1, was Sweden's first nuclear reactor. Inaugurated in 1954, it is located 25 meters underground in a cavern blasted out of the bedrock directly beneath the KTH Royal Institute of Technology campus in central Stockholm.</p>
    <p>The reactor, which was used for research in nuclear physics and chemistry, was decommissioned in 1970. After being completely dismantled and decontaminated, the unique and dramatic subterranean space has been transformed. Today, the Reactor Hall serves as a one-of-a-kind venue for cultural events, art installations, concerts, and performances, representing a fascinating intersection of scientific history, Cold War-era architecture, and contemporary arts.</p>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>Here's a raddle! Connect the previous word with a hint to transform your word into another. The length of the answer is also defined.</p>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <p>We find that <strong>REACTOR</strong> only fits with the hint "In some nuclear _____s, this element is used as a neutron moderator.". So we put them together into "In some nuclear <strong>reactor</strong>s, this element is used as a neutron moderator." What 6 letter word is the hint describing? It's <strong>CARBON</strong>. So our next word to use is <strong>CARBON</strong>.</p>

    <p>Hints in no special order:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> A <code>_____</code> often propagates as a...</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> A bundle of fibers that transmits impulses based on <code>_____</code> organs to the brain.</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> Atoms of <code>_____</code> form this type of covalent connection to create diamond.</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> Heating the <code>_____</code> to high temperatures can create this amorphous solid.</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> In a crystal, the energy level of each chemical <code>_____</code> contributes to a larger structure called</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled checked> In some nuclear <code>_____</code>s, this element is used as a neutron moderator.</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> On a beach, one might find a <code>_____</code> of this granular material.</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> The electrical impulse transmitted by a <code>_____</code>.</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> The faculty of sight, which relies on an optical <code>_____</code>, is one of the five of these.</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> To focus light, microscopes use a shaped piece of <code>_____</code>.</li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> What a <code>_____</code> transfers from one point to another without transferring matter.</li>
